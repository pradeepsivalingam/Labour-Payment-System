# Labour-Payment-System
The Labour Payment System is a simple digital platform that helps manage labour details, daily work updates, attendance, and wage calculations. It replaces manual registers and reduces errors in payment tracking. Employers can add workers, record their daily shifts or hours, and the system automatically calculates weekly or monthly wages.
